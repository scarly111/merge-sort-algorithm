# merge-sort-algorithm

This project was created to learn and implement the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Purpose

- To understand the logic behind the Merge Sort algorithm, which is based on the **Divide and Conquer** principle.

- To perform the sorting process using a single recursive function (mergeSort(arr, sortedArr)), handling both splitting and merging.
